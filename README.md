# IoT-Based Food Perish Prevention System

A smart, Arduino-based temperature-controlled container system designed to preserve perishable food items during transportation. The system uses sensors and actuators to maintain optimal environmental conditions and sends real-time data to ThingSpeak via the ESP-01 WiFi module.

## üìã Features

- Monitors temperature and humidity using DHT11, LM35, and DS18B20 sensors.
- User-selectable modes for **Hot** or **Cold** storage via push buttons.
- Food type selection (Milk, Drinks, Puffs, Sandwich) for tailored temperature settings.
- Peltier module for cooling and 12V cartridge heater for heating.
- Real-time display on a 16x2 I2C LCD.
- Sends sensor data to **ThingSpeak** using ESP-01 for remote monitoring.

## üì° How It Works

1. On startup, LCD prompts the user to select **Hot** or **Cold** mode.
2. User then selects a food item (e.g., Milk, Sandwich).
3. Based on selection, system sets appropriate temperature thresholds.
4. Sensors monitor real-time temperature and humidity.
5. Arduino controls Peltier or Heater via relays.
6. Data is sent to **ThingSpeak** using ESP-01 WiFi module.

## üåê ThingSpeak Setup

1. Create an account on [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com).
2. Create a new channel and enable fields for temperature and humidity.
3. Use the API Key in your Arduino code to upload data using ESP-01.
